# sql-librarian

Group project with Cole Trumbo, Rory Burke, Daniel Barone, and Kevin Lai.


The SQL procedures I wrote:
admin_branches,
check_card_numer_exists,
get_books_due

Plus a procedure to get the books available for checkout at a given branch (checking that noOfCopies is greater than book loaned out.) This was replaced with other proceedures along the way.

I also helped with the Borrower class in python.

I ran through the program testing various cases, and researched unittest and unittest.mock. Since nobody on the team had experience with it, the team felt it was simpler to test manually, as the program is small.
